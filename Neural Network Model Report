For this part of the assignment, youâ€™ll write a report on the performance of the deep learning model you created for Alphabet Soup.

The report should contain the following:

Overview of the analysis: Alphabet Soup, a nonprofit foundation, is seeking a predictive tool to aid in selecting funding recipients who are most likely to succeed in their endeavors. This analysis focuses on constructing a binary classifier using machine learning and neural networks. The dataset provided comprises more than 34,000 organizations that have received Alphabet Soup's funding over time. 

Results:

Data Preprocessing

- What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model?
The target variable corresponds to the 'IS_SUCCESSFUL' column extracted from the application_df dataset.

- What variable(s) are the features for your model?
All remaining columns from the application_df dataset, except for the 'IS_SUCCESSFUL' column, were considered as the feature variables in the model.

- What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features?
Both the 'EIN' and 'NAME' columns were excluded from consideration since they did not function as either targets or features within the dataset.

Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

- How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
In the initial trial, a configuration of 8 hidden nodes for the first layer and 5 hidden nodes for the second layer was implemented. These choices were essentially initial approximations that were subject to refinement in the subsequent iteration.

- Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
It is regrettable that the model did not achieve the targeted accuracy level of 75%.

- What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?
Efforts were directed towards incorporating additional layers, excluding further columns, introducing supplementary hidden nodes, and alternating the activation functions attributed to each layer, all in a concerted effort to enhance the model's predictive accuracy.
Synopsis: Compiling an overarching summary of the outcomes derived from the deep learning model. Additionally, formulating a suggestion for an alternative model capable of resolving this classification predicament, followed by an elucidation of the rationale for this suggestion.

Summary:
The deep learning model yielded an accuracy rate of roughly 73% when predicting the classification issue. It is probable that deploying a model characterized by a more pronounced correlation between input and output variables would yield enhanced predictive accuracy. This could be accomplished by means of comprehensive preliminary data cleansing, coupled with the application of a model employing diverse activation functions, iterating until an elevated level of accuracy is attained.
